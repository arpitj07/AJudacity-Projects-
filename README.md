## AIND-Recognizer
### Sign Language Recognizer
Built a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL). Trained a set of Hidden Markov Models & identify individual words from test sequences.


## AIND-Planning
### Implement a Planning Search
Used logic & planning techniques to create an AI that finds the most efficient route. This project used a combination of propositional logic & search along with A* heuristics to find optimal planning solutions.

## AIND-Isolation
### Game-Playing Agent
Created an AI that beats human opponents in the game of Isolation using Minimax, Alpha-Beta Search, and Iterative Deepening.

## AIND-Sudoku
### An AI Agent to solve Sudoku
Created an AI to solve Diagonal Sudokus using constraint propagation and search techniques. Additionally, taught the agent to use the Naked Twins advanced Sudoku strategy.
